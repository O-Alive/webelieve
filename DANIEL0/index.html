<p> we believe, we're a bock chain project that helps you bring your dreams alive, we are a society of believers.</p>
<h2> Why We Exist </h2>
<p> we are here for you, for each other cause we 
	realize how difficult it is to bring a dream alive alone, an example of this we link back to 
	a story of how one man cant build a house on his own, just like in the ancient times in 
	nigerian tribes, where of one man wants to build him self his house, he seeks help from everyone in his community, and they build it together, and eveyone buildss each other house together, now thats who we are.
	<h3> How We Function </h3>
	<p> well just like shark tanks shows, where one goes to the big stage to reesent his ideas, we operate almost the same way, the difference is that both big and small sharks are allowed to invest in projects that they believe / attracted to </p>
